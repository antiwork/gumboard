## Pull Requests

1. Update documentation if you're changing behavior
2. Add or update tests for your changes
3. Include screenshots of your test suite passing locally
4. Use native-sounding English in all communication with no excessive capitalization (e.g HOW IS THIS GOING), multiple question marks (how's this going???), grammatical errors (how's dis going), or typos (thnx fr update).
   - ❌ Before: "is this still open ?? I am happy to work on it ??"
   - ✅ After: "Is this actively being worked on? I've started work on it here…"
5. Make sure all tests pass
6. Request a review from maintainers
7. After reviews begin, avoid force-pushing to your branch
   - Force-pushing rewrites history and makes review threads hard to follow
   - Don't worry about messy commits - we squash everything when merging to main
8. Self-review your PR with explanatory comments for any non-intuitive or non-obvious changes to help reviewers understand your reasoning
9. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer

## Writing Bug Reports

A great bug report includes:

  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
